        Narasimha Konda, located approximately 15 kilometers from Nellore in Andhra Pradesh, is a revered hill shrine dedicated to Lord Narasimha, the fourth avatar of Lord Vishnu. Perched on the banks of the Penna River, the Sri Vedagiri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple atop the hill is believed to have been established by Sage Kashyapa and later constructed by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 9th century. The temple holds significant mythological importance, with legends stating that the Saptarishis performed yagnas here, and references to the site are found in both the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The hill, rising to about 350 feet, offers panoramic views and is considered a sacred pilgrimage destination. Annual festivals like Brahmotsavam and Krishna Janmashtami are celebrated with great fervor, attracting devotees from various regions. Narasimha Konda stands as a testament to the region's rich spiritual heritage and architectural grandeur.
