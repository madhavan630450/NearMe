        The Sri Talpagiri Ranganatha Swamy Temple in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, is a historic and revered shrine dedicated to Lord Ranganatha, a reclining form of Lord Vishnu. Located on the banks of the Penna River, the temple dates back to the Pallava period and saw significant contributions from the Chola and Pandya dynasties. It is known for its magnificent seven-tiered Raja Gopuram, built in 1849, and its unique west-facing sanctum, which houses a 10-foot-long idol of Lord Ranganatha reclining on Adisesha. The temple also features shrines for Goddess Ranganayaki, Andal, and the Alwars, along with a beautiful mirror hall known as Addala Mandapam. Celebrated for its grand Brahmotsavam festival held annually in March or April, the temple is both a spiritual and architectural landmark, believed to rest on Adisesha who transformed into a hill to serve as the divine couch for Lord Vishnu.
